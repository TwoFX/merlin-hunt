<h1>Merlin Hunt</h1>

<p>The Merlin Hunt is a virtual puzzle hunt for people who know how to program.
It consists of a series of little puzzles to be solved in a team of two or three
people. Most of the puzzles will require programming knowledge in one way or another.
Participation is open to everyone who likes puzzles.</p>

<p>It is written and organized by Markus Himmel.</p>

<p>The canonical location of this document is <a href="https://static.markushimmel.de/information.html">https://static.markushimmel.de/information.html</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not mandatory to stay until the end. Everyone is welcome to

<h3>Contest location</h3>
<p>The puzzle hunt can be completely played online using a computer. All official
communication will be via Discord.
It is recommended that teams meet in one place to participate.</p>
<p>There will be a limited amount of space for teams to participate onsite in Karlsruhe (just for the fun of it).
If you would like to participate onsite, please indicate this during sign-up. If
there are more interested teams than there is space in my flat, I will decide which
teams are allowed to come.</p>
<p>If you participate onsite, please bring a pair of headphones!</p>

<h3>Teams and registration</h3>

<p>Participants should participate in teams of two or three people. Forming larger
teams is possible but not recommended. Participating alone is also possible but
strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>To register a team, send me (Discord handle: TwoFx#6343) a private
message on Discord.</p>

<p>Please include the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your team name</li>
	<li>The names and Discord handles of all team members</li>
	<li>Which team member is the captain</li>
	<li>Whether or not you would like to participate onsite in Karlsruhe</li>
</ul>

<p>While it will be possible to sign up right until the contest starts, please
sign up as early as possible.</p>

<p>If you do not have a team, feel free to message me and I will try to match you up
with other individuals who are looking for a team.</p>

<h2>Competition format</h2>
<p> The puzzle hunt is contained in a single zip file. In the zip file, you will
find the first puzzle as well as an encrypted zip file containing the remaining
tasks. Using the solution of the first puzzle, you can decrypt the zip file,
giving you access to the second task as well as an encrypted zip file containing
the remaining tasks. This goes on until you have solved all puzzles.</p>

<p>The initial zip file containing the first task will be distributed via Discord
shortly before the contest. You should download the
initial zip file in advance as it is relatively large (750-800 MB).</p>

<h3>Explanation video</h3>
<p>Please watch the following video to understand how participating in the contest works:</p>
<blockquote>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9AIA9cQNfE">Merlin Hunt Demonstration</a>.
</blockquote>

<h3>DOMJudge</h3>
<p>Each team's progress is tracked via an online system called DOMJudge. The URL of
the DOMJudge system is</p>
<blockquote>
	<a href="https://domjudge.markushimmel.de/">https://domjudge.markushimmel.de/</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>You will obtain credentials for DOMJudge after signing up. The same credentials
will work for the practice session and the main contest.</p>

<p>On the DOMJudge page, there will be a live ranking of all participating teams.
The teams will be sorted using ICPC scoring rules, which basically means that
to appear at the top of the leaderboard, you should solve many puzzles and do
so quickly and with few hints.</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>If you get stuck on a puzzle, it is possible to request a hint. You may only
request a hint if you have been working on a puzzle for at least 30 minutes
(as measured by the last successful submission on DOMJudge).</p>

<p>To request a hint, you should do two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>In DOMJudge, submit the file \texttt{request-hint.flag}, which you received
		as part of the initial zip file, as an attempt for the puzzle you
		want to request a hint for. You will receive a verdict of Wrong Answer.</li>
	<li>Send me a private message on Discord.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will then join you for a quick voice call to get you un-stuck. If you solve
the puzzle later, you will receive a time penalty of 20 minutes for each hint
you needed.</p>

<h2>Rules and advice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Before the contest, you should make sure that you are able to decrypt
		files that were encrypted using GnuPG. On Linux, this is accomplished
		using the command-line tool <code>gpg</code>. On Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and derivatives, you can
		install it by saying
		<pre>
			sudo apt install gnupg
		</pre>
		You can decrypt a file using the invocation
		<pre>
			gpg -d task.zip.gpg > task.zip
		</pre>
		There are also GUI tools available on Windows and Linux.</li>
	<li>It is strongly recommended that at least one team member has access
		to a reasonably powerful Linux machine or VM. As long as it's not a Raspberry Pi, you're probably fine.</li>
	<li>Using multiple computers per team and using the internet is permitted.</li>
	<li>After solving a puzzle, you should know exactly what the solution to
		the puzzle is. Do not try to brute force the passphrase, even if you
		believe that you have reduced the number of possible passphrases to a
		small number.</li>
	<li>Some puzzles will require interacting with externally hosted services.
		Please be considerate and do not spam them with a large number of automated
		requests.</li>
	<li>The name of a puzzle is part of the puzzle. The full name of each puzzle
		can be viewed in the DOMJudge submit dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice session</h2>
<p>There will be a practice session to test your understanding of the contest format and
get familiar with <code>gpg</code>, DOMJudge and so on. It will work just like the real
contest, except that the problems are uninteresting dummy problems and you will have
multiple days to participate at your leisure.</p>

<p>Participation in the practice session is optional but recommended.
You can spend as much or as little time as you like
on the practice session, but an hour should be more than enough.</p>

<p>The practice session will run
from February 10 to February 24. The problem package and initial passphrase for the practice session
will be made available via Discord.</p>

<h2>Extended contest</h2>
<p>After the contest has ended, the contest infrastructure will remain accessible for
a few more weeks or months. There will be an extended contest in DOMJudge so that you can
continue solving the puzzles past the end of the contest if you wish.</p>
